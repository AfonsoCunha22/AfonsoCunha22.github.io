        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Keen to learn student with an MSc in Human-Centered AI underway at the Technical University of Denmark, complementing a
            solid foundation in Computer Science from the Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal. As a BI Analyst and Data Analytics Trainee at SDG
            Group, I excelled in international projects, particularly in the medical field. Experienced in teaching Object-Oriented Programming
            and actively engaging in extracurriculars, I try to bring a unique blend of technical expertise and a human-centered approach. Also
            engaging in other extracurricular hobbies such as music and volleyball.</p>

          <p class="small-gray-text">Tools: Angular, Javascript, HTML, CSS</p>
          <p>This project consists on inovating and transitioning from an Excel based process to a more linear, simpler and automized approach of the existing process regarding professor category and salary review system for Instituto Politécnico de Setúbal. Until that time, the entire process was done manually and was highly exhausting both for reviewers and professor.</p>

          <h3>Food Bank Analysis - Copenhagen Region</h3>
          <p class="small-gray-text">Tools: Python, Clustering, Apriori, Scrapping</p>
          <p>This project tackles food waste by creating a data-driven food bank system using
            surplus food from stores. Data from the Salling Group API, including store locations
            and items nearing expiration, served as the foundation. The Anti-Food Waste API pro-
            vided daily updates on surplus items . A constrained agglomerative clustering algorithm
            grouped stores by proximity, assigning each cluster a food bank location. Recipes scraped
            from online sources were structured and matched to surplus items for practical utilization.
            By combining clustering, recipe analysis, and surplus data, the project offers a scalable
            solution to reduce food waste and support community welfare.</p>

          <h3>Real vs Fake Discriminator</h3>
          <p class="small-gray-text">Tools: CNN, ViT, DIRE, Fine-Tuning</p>
          <p>This project focuses on detecting hyper-realistic synthetic images, such as deepfakes, using frequency domain analysis and various machine learning models. By analyzing frequency patterns in a custom dataset of real and synthetic images, three models were evaluated: DIRE, a custom-built CNN, and a fine-tuned vision transformer (ViT). The results demonstrate the potential of combining spectral analysis with advanced machine learning models to enhance synthetic image detection and ensure media authenticity.</p>

          <span class="small-gray-text">May 2022 - May 2023</span><br>
          During my tenure at SDG Group, I had the opportunity to collaborate with international teams on a large scale project involving companies in the medical field. This experience significantly broadened my perspective and skills in managing complex, global projects. I was able to, for the first time, understand the true scope of a data science service providing company, gaining insights into how such organizations operate on a global scale. I also learned new tools and paradigms, such as Snowflake and dbt, which enhanced my ability to work with data in a dynamic environment and contribute effectively to project outcomes.</p>

          <span class="small-gray-text">Dec 2021 - Feb 2022</span><br>
          I served as a Teaching Assistant for an Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming course, where Java was the primary programming language. This role allowed me to assist students with their understanding of key programming concepts while further enhancing my own knowledge of computer science. Working closely with both students and the lead instructor, I developed strong teaching and communication skills and provided individualized support to help students succeed. It was a rewarding experience to facilitate learning and introduce students to the fundamentals of programming.</p>

          At KSC PT, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project focused on warehouse optimization. This experience allowed me to explore a new area that I was eager to learn about as a student, marking a fulfilling end to my bachelor's education. I was exposed to unfamiliar but intriguing tools and paradigms, while also applying the knowledge I gained from my studies at the Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal.</p>
