<h3> San Francisco reaches peak in prostitution crime rate in 2008 </h3>	

<p>
Why did prostitution reached its peak in 2008 and what influences the San Francisco prostitution crime rate? To answer this question, we look into data collected by the San Francisco Police Department spanning from 2004 to 2013. This dataset displays various crime categories, each logged with timestamps and geographical coordinates.  Focusing specifically on the prostitution category within the years 2004 to 2013, intriguing trends can be witnessed. It appears that the incidents of prostitution-related crimes increased in 2007 and 2008, only to steadily decline thereafter. By 2012, the data reveals the lowest recorded rate of such offenses over the preceding decade.  In this exploration, we aim to overview the patterns of prostitution crimes, shedding light on shifts in societal behaviors and law enforcement efforts over the examined timeframe.

<h3> Why this peak? </h3>
<p>
The year 2008 is a year that was heavily influenced by the economic recession triggered by the U.S. housing market collapse and systemic failures in governmental regulatory. This event led to staggering job losses, lower GDP figures, and financial instability many people. Governments worldwide implemented strategies to stabilize economies, yet the road to recovery proved though, spanning several years.  During periods of high unemployment rates, individuals often find themselves suffering with economic uncertainty, potentially leading some to resort to criminal activities as a means of financial income. The economic recession offers a plausible explanation for the peak in prostitution crime rate observed in 2008, with a gradual decline following as the economy stabilized during the recovery phase spanning from 2010 to 2013.  The significance of this recovery phase is discussed in the article "San Francisco's Economic Recovery: 2010-2013" published by Spur The Urbanist in 2014. The article highlights a great increase in employment figures, with the city witnessing the addition of 70,000 jobs during this period.

To better comprehend the nature of prostitution-related crimes, let's investigate the weekday distribution of incidents.

Based on data provided by the San Francisco Police Department, the visualization illustrates the decline in reported incidents of prostitution from 2004 to 2013. Despite common assumptions associating prostitution with weekend activities and nightlife, the data presents a different reality. Surprisingly, the analysis reveals that Wednesday records the highest frequency of reported incidents, followed closely by Thursday and Tuesday.  This observation challenges stereotypes and emphasizes the nature of criminal activities within urban contexts. Rather than aligning with weekend leisure, the peak in reported incidents during 2007-2008 primarily comes from occurrences on weekdays, particularly Wednesday and Tuesday. This also links to previous suggestions that unemployment can lead to more crime cases, as more people need income, and more people are free during daytime weekdays. Notably, the weekend—encompassing Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—maintains a relatively stable crime rate throughout the ten-year period.
