<h1> Prostitution in San Francisco </h1>
## Prostitution rates (2004 - 2013)

<p>
Why did prostitution reached its peak in 2008 and what influences the San Francisco prostitution crime rate? To answer this question, we look into data collected by the San Francisco Police Department spanning from 2004 to 2013. This dataset displays various crime categories, each logged with timestamps and geographical coordinates.  Focusing specifically on the prostitution category within the years 2004 to 2013, intriguing trends can be witnessed. It appears that the incidents of prostitution-related crimes increased in 2007 and 2008, only to steadily decline thereafter. By 2012, the data reveals the lowest recorded rate of such offenses over the preceding decade.  In this exploration, we aim to overview the patterns of prostitution crimes, shedding light on shifts in societal behaviors and law enforcement efforts over the examined timeframe.

## Why this peak? 
<p>
The year 2008 is a year that was heavily influenced by the economic recession triggered by the U.S. housing market collapse and systemic failures in governmental regulatory. This event led to staggering job losses, lower GDP figures, and financial instability many people. Governments worldwide implemented strategies to stabilize economies, yet the road to recovery proved though, spanning several years.  During periods of high unemployment rates, individuals often find themselves suffering with economic uncertainty, potentially leading some to resort to criminal activities as a means of financial income. The economic recession offers a plausible explanation for the peak in prostitution crime rate observed in 2008, with a gradual decline following as the economy stabilized during the recovery phase spanning from 2010 to 2013.  The significance of this recovery phase is discussed in the article "San Francisco's Economic Recovery: 2010-2013" published by Spur The Urbanist in 2014. The article highlights a great increase in employment figures, with the city witnessing the addition of 70,000 jobs during this period.

Looking at San Francisco, various factors and changes in law enforcement and public policy offer insights. Over recent years, there's been a notable shift in how law enforcement and the legal system handle prostitution. One significant legislative change in California aimed to reduce street-level prostitution and its associated crimes is the end of arrests for loitering for prostitution. This change reflects a broader trend towards decriminalization and a focus on protecting vulnerable populations involved in sex work, rather than punitive measures. Such legislative changes are part of a wider shift in approach, possibly contributing to the observed decline in prostitution cases ("California will end arrests for loitering for prostitution" - KPBS Public Media).

## What day is prostitution related crimes committed?
<p>
To better comprehend the nature of prostitution-related crimes, let's investigate the weekday distribution of incidents.

Based on data provided by the San Francisco Police Department, the visualization illustrates the decline in reported incidents of prostitution from 2004 to 2013. Despite common assumptions associating prostitution with weekend activities and nightlife, the data presents a different reality. Surprisingly, the analysis reveals that Wednesday records the highest frequency of reported incidents, followed closely by Thursday and Tuesday.  This observation challenges stereotypes and emphasizes the nature of criminal activities within urban contexts. Rather than aligning with weekend leisure, the peak in reported incidents during 2007-2008 primarily comes from occurrences on weekdays, particularly Wednesday and Tuesday. This also links to previous suggestions that unemployment can lead to more crime cases, as more people need income, and more people are free during daytime weekdays. Notably, the weekend—encompassing Friday, Saturday, and Sunday—maintains a relatively stable crime rate throughout the ten-year period.

# Prostitution Cases in San Francisco

<p>
The areas of Tenderloin, Mission, Northern, and Central districts in San Francisco are historically known for their high incidence of various types of crimes, including prostitution. This pattern is not only a reflection of the socio-economic fabric of these neighborhoods but also of the policing and community responses to the issues.
</p>


## Tenderloin

<p>
The Tenderloin district has long been considered one of the most troubled areas in San Francisco, known for its homelessness, drug trade, and as a hotspot for prostitution. The concentration of affordable housing and social services, alongside a high density of bars and clubs, creates an environment where such activities can flourish. Efforts to revitalize the area have been ongoing, with community organizations working alongside law enforcement to address these complex issues.
</p>


## Mission

<p>
The Mission district, known for its vibrant cultural and artistic community, also faces challenges related to street-level crimes, including prostitution. Economic disparities and gentrification have contributed to social tensions in the area, affecting the prevalence and visibility of street crimes. Community policing efforts and neighborhood initiatives aim to tackle these problems by fostering a safer and more inclusive environment.
</p>


## Northern and Central

<p>
The Northern and Central districts, covering areas like Polk Gulch, have seen varied levels of street crime, including prostitution. These areas, particularly near entertainment and nightlife venues, can become focal points for such activities. Police patrols and community vigilance are key strategies in managing these issues, with an emphasis on harm reduction and support for those involved in the sex trade.

The presence of prostitution in these districts and the strategies employed to address it reflect the broader challenges of urban crime and social justice. Balancing enforcement with support for vulnerable populations is a critical aspect of the response in San Francisco, with initiatives aimed at reducing demand for prostitution, providing exit pathways for those involved, and addressing the underlying social determinants.
